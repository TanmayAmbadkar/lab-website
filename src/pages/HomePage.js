                            Our research is dedicated to advancing the frontier of <strong>Trustworthy Artificial Intelligence</strong>. While modern Deep Neural Networks are powerful, their "black-box" nature presents significant challenges that limit their deployment in high-stakes environments. These models are often:

                            <li><strong>Hard to interpret</strong>, making them difficult to audit and debug.</li>
                            <li><strong>Hard to formally verify</strong>, preventing provable guarantees of their behavior.</li>
                            <li><strong>Unreliable</strong>, showing high variability based on factors like random initialization.</li>
                            <li><strong>Lacking in domain awareness</strong>, unable to incorporate commonsense knowledge.</li>
                        </ul>

                            The Whitebox AI Lab directly confronts these drawbacks. Our central mission is to build intelligent systems that are <strong>reliable, transparent, and secure</strong> by pioneering new techniques at the intersection of <strong>machine learning</strong> and <strong>formal methods</strong>. By creating deep connections between the inductive learning of neural networks and the rigorous logic of symbolic reasoning, we are forging a path toward a new generation of AI that can be truly trusted.
